CalThing, or 'Calendar Thingy,' is a simple website built by the three DSU undergraduates Eric, Blake, and Tristan. The purpose of CalThing is to make a simple interface for DSU students to view current events, which are currently distributed as biweekly emails. To achieve this, this application relys on Python to scrape the email and push data to a remote MySQL database. The PHP backend then pulls the data down and displays it.

This code base has been abandoned in favor of a newer, cleaner version, which may be created in the near future.
